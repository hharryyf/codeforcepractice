I did this virtual contest with one of my teammate. We solved all 
problems in 1h40min. 

A. Valera and X (diff=1000, simulation)

B. Marathon (diff=1500, simple math)

C. Restore Graph (diff=1800, constructive algorithm)

D. Minesweeper 1D (diff=1900, dp)
By defining dp[i][0-4][0/1] as the number of ways of placing the first i cells with the ith cell 
with 0/1/2/* and the i+1 cell is/isn't a *.

E. Maze 1D (diff=2200, binary search on final answer)
This is an incredible problem. Firstly, we should see k = 0 or k = 1. Then, we should notice that 
if the block is on the left, the final position of the robot must be at the positive x and similarly
if the block is on the right, robot must be at neagtive x. Thus, by using this property, we can 
binary search on the leftmost and rightmost position that the block can be put.
