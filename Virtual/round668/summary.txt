I participated this virtual contest individually, for the first time in 
history eliminating all the problems.

A. Permutation Forgery (diff=800, math, WA = 0)
Just reverse the permutation and print.

B. Array Cancellation (diff=1000, simple greedy, WA = 0)
Just maintain a prefix sum, the answer is abs(min(prefix[i])) where 1 <= i <= n, 
prefix[i] is negative.

C. Balanced Bitstring (diff=1500, greedy, WA = 0)
We observe that every numbers in a chunk (chunk is partitioned by i % k) must be the same.
The rest is very simple.

D. Tree Tag (diff=1900, observation, WA = 0)
Initially, I think this problem as undoable so I solved E first. The observation is if 2 * da >= db,
Alice must win. For case 2 * da + 1 <= db, by drawing several diagrams we should observe Alice cannot
catch Bob if the diameter of the tree is less than 2 * da + 1.

E. Fixed Point Removal (diff=2300, line sweep, range tree, WA = 0)
Key observations: we should remove the points from right to left, i.e. remove the first removable point on the right,
because removing points on the right would not affect the points on the left. Then, we should observe that a point
is removable only if the potentially removable points on the left is no less than i - a[i] (if a[i] > i, the point is never removable). 
Hence, the problem is reduced to a standard "one ocurrence" type line sweep problem which can be done by range tree.
