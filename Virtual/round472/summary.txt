VK cup is quite difficult, even for a div2 round. The problems
are quite hard to understand. This is my worst performance so far,
solving only 3 of the 5 problems. The worst performance is mainly
because of a wrong strategy.

A. Tritonic Iridescence (diff=1300, greedy)
Just fill the certain ?, if there's ? remaining and no contradiction,
the answer is yes.

B. Mystical Mosaic (diff=1300, logic)
No magic, just implementation.

C. Three-level Laser (diff=1600, binary search, greedy)
Key observation: j must be i + 1.

D. Riverside Curio (diff=1700, greedy)
I didn't even understand about this simple problem in the contest, the main reason
is because the process described in the problem seems a bit complicated. However,
the problem is very simple. The trick here is we can write out the set of inequalities,
then greedily fulfill d[i].

E. Contact ATC (diff=2500, divide and conquer)
This is the problem that cost me dearly. The problem is very simple, we can just write out
the constraints of the wind if (i, j) pair is valid. We should then observe this is equivalent
of asking us how many inversion pairs are there if we sort by x / (v - w) and let the array be
x / (v + w). The trickiest part is only sorting according to the pair is not enough, we must
sort according to x / (v + w) in non-decreasing order !!!!!
