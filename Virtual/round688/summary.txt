Tom and I solved 5 out of 6 problems in this round which was acceptable.

A. Cancel the Trains (diff=800, implementation)

B. Suffix Operations (diff=1400, simple simulation)

C. Triangles (diff=1700, greedy, case work)

D. Checkpoints (diff=1900, constructive algorithm)
The observation of this problem is the pattern 10, 100, 1000 is extremely useful.

E. Dog Snacks (diff=2300, greedy, dp)
The only tricky part of this problem is we must process the root (v=1) seperately.
