This is a strange round, a lot of ad-hoc problems.
I solved only 4 out of 6 problems.

A. Suffix Three (diff=800, simulation)

B. Azamon Web Services (diff=1600, greedy, WA=4)
We should swap the last smallest alternatives not the first one, be careful
about the implenetation.

C. Cut and Paste (diff=1700, implementation)
Note that x is relatively small, we brute force when i is less than or equal to x,
and for the other case, we simply use math on that.

D. Beingawesomeism (diff=1800, constructive algorithm)
Just be careful about implementation.

E. Jeremy Bearimy (diff=2000, dfs)
I have no idea on how to solve the maximum case. The maximum case is consider the maximum
contribution of each edge when linking connected components (i.e. w * min(n - sz[v], sz[v])).

F. Miss Punyverse (diff=2500, dp)
Quite hard, still need time to digest.
