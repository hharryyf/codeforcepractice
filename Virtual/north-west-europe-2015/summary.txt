A. 
This is a greedy problem, standard sort on left end point and use priority queue on right end point trick.

B.


C.
This problem is very simple, the overall satisfiability can be interpreted as a 2-CNF.
The only thing that should be very careful is we must use the segment intersection template that works in integer field not double, 
otherwise the precision is going to fail.

D.
Very simple dynamic programming.

E.
Easy bipartite matching model.

G.
Each number has a 3D coordinate (x, y, z), with this observation the problem is a standard 3D point counting
problem. We can use CDQ to solve the problem.

I.
One of the easiest problem of the entire contest.

J.
One of the easiest problem of the entire contest.

K.
Very simple, just manipulating the three dishes.
