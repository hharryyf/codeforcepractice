I participated this round with Tom, we solved 5 out of 6 problems together.
I solved A, D, E. Tom solved B, C and also E.
https://codeforces.com/contest/1321

A. Contest for Robots (diff=900, simulation)

B. Journey Planning (diff=1400, simluation)

C. Remove Adjacent (diff=1600, simple greedy)

D. Navigation System (diff=1700, BFS)
key observation: edge must be on the shortest path and edge can be on the shortest path are the edges we are interested in.

E. World of Darkraft: Battle for Azathoth (diff=2000, line sweep and range tree)
This problem is extremely standard right now.

F. Reachable Strings (diff=2500, range tree, hashing)
We failed to make any progress on this in the contest. This problem is extremely technical.
Key observation: the reachability is an equivalence relation. We just need to compare whether two substrings both reachable 
to the same string with the least alphabetical order.
Observation 2: we can use range tree to do this maintain the hash value of segments, when merging two segments, only when
left.right = true, right.left = true we need to do a rehash.
