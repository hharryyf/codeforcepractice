I participated this virtual round individually solving all problems in ~1h,
and rank 5 in the end.

A. Minimum Difficulty (diff=900, brute force, simulation)
Key observation: O(n) works, but since n is so small we can brute force.

B. Secret Combination (diff=1500, brute force, implementation)
Key observation: the 2 operations are abelian, we can simply brute force all 10000 possibilities.

C. Removing Columns (diff=1500, greedy)
Key observation: we greedily select the colunms we are saving from left to right.

D. Tennis Game (diff=1900, time complexity analysis)
Key observation: each t there's only one valid s. And t is from 1 to n. Note the serie simulation
n + n / 2 + n / 3 + ... is O(nlogn), as long as we can fast jump to validate each t we are done.
Validation is not hard at all, the only edge case here is if A wins more sets, A must win the last set as well.

E. Distributing Parts (diff=2100, greedy, line sweep)
Key observation: we sort the plays and actors according to right and plays are in front of actors to break the tie.
Then, we do a line sweep and greedily select the leftmost valid play for actors.
