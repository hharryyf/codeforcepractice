I participated this round individually, solved 4 of the 5 problems.

A. Line to Cashier (diff=800, simulation)

B. Garland (diff=1200, simulation, WA = 1)
Read the problem statement carefully.

C. Triangle (diff=1600, similar triangle, WA = 4)
Be careful about the condition of NO, b % a != 0 might be YES as well.

D. Long Path (diff=1600, interval dp)
We define dp[i][j] as the number of moves from i and go over j.

E. Curious Array (diff=2500, combinatorics, prefix sum)
I failed to solve this in the contest. There is a very importance result on comb numbers.
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  1 2 3 4 5 6
    1 3 6 10 15

We should observe that C(i, j) is actually equal to sum(C(i-1, k)) where k = 0..j-1.
This implies that we can use 101 dimension of prefix sum to solve this.
