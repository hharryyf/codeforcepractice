We did this round as a team of 2 and solved 5 out of 6 problems. Since F has a rating of 3100, 
failed to solve that is completely normal.

A. Dungeon (diff=1100)
Too simple, details ignored.

B. Find The Array (diff=1400, constructive algorithm)
Too simple, use the closest power of 2 would work.

C. Busy Robot (diff=1800, simulation, implementation)

D. Pairs (diff=1900, greedy)
The idea is the answer is within an interval [l, r] and we should consider how to find the bounds. l can be found by iterating backward,
and put the first element smaller than a[i] if exists, otherwise, the largest element. r can be found by iterationg forward in a similar
manner. 

E. Plan of Lectures (diff=2400, top-sort, union find)
We can complete the problem in 4 steps, 1) use union find to merge the points of the second type together, if cycle exists, no solution
2) run top sort on components. 3) extract the single linked-lists from components according to top sort order. 
4) validate if the obtained answer is correct.
