https://codeforces.com/contest/455/problem/D

135. Music in Car (diff=2500, line sweep and sets, I think this problem requires some implementation techniques, for example creating
two structs instead of using functions to handle the time addition event would make our life a lot easier)
https://codeforces.com/contest/746/problem/F

136. Play on Words (central Europe, union find and Euler path existence checking, I think the most important observation is using words as "edges" of the graph) https://vjudge.net/problem/UVA-10129

137. Cardboard Box (diff=2500, greedy and fenwick tree, I was killed by this problem :( )
This problem requires the following greedy observation, suppose that an optimal solution has the maximum b[k] at index k, then
we could proof that all [1:k] have been selected at least for level 1. Then the problem is quite routine, using fenwick tree and
binary search would easily give a solution of O(n*logn*logn).
https://codeforces.com/contest/436/problem/E

138. Catenyms (least alphabetical ordered Euler path and Hierholzer's algorithm)
https://vjudge.net/problem/UVA-10441

139. Bear and Contribution (diff=2500, greedy and priority queue)
I wasted valuable time because of ignoring the fact that the final T can be a number not in the given array.
This problem has a very trivial greedy observation which is we need to select k numbers that has the minimum cost to increase
them to T. However, we need to be aware how to maintain a window of k numbers with minimum cost, using priority queue here is
definitly the best choice. https://codeforces.com/contest/639/problem/D

140. Working routine (diff=2600, linked list)
This problem requires some implementation technique, firstly since n = 1000, m = 1000 and q = 10000, we know that O((m+n)q) is
good enough to pass the tests. Note that swapping two submatrix only require to change the connection links. Hence, linked-list
is the best data structure for this type of query. https://codeforces.com/contest/706/problem/E

141. Donkey and Stars (diff=2600, line sweep and geometry and range tree)
This problem taught me some valuable lessons even if I solved it without the support of any solutions. 1. when we are solving
geometry problems, use "/" as few as possible to eliminate TLE. 2. pair<int, index (int)> would be more efficient than pair<int, object> when making a pair. Beyond that, this problem is still very nice. We firstly changed the problem to a LIS problem by math observation,
and after that since the > is defined by two conditions, we can use the standard trick of range tree and line sweep to solve it.
https://codeforces.com/contest/249/problem/D

142. Trips (diff=2100, graph connectivity, working backward and sets)
This graph problem is very interesting. The key observation is when i increases from 1 to m, the tourist set size can only increase.
Hence, we can work backward, firstly add in all the edges. Then, we delete all the edges one by one and always see whether there's an
element with degree less than k, if so eliminate the element. https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1037/E
